          <h2 class="monthly-h2">2021 MARCH MONTHLY GENERAL COMMENT</h2>
        <p>Dear astrology lovers,</p>
        <p>Although it is cold, we have arrived in March, when we will begin to see the first lights of spring. We enter this month with the new moon in Pisces. You can follow the effects of this new month, which will not taint our eyes, from the weekly horoscope comments.</p>
        <p>While Saturn, our teacher with a ruler, is trying to make us more equipped, this time it will enter into a harsh appearance with the north and south lunar nodes. This stern look is not the kind that will make you say, "Oh God, we're on fire". On the contrary, it will be the kind that will make you say, "Actually, it can change" when using sentences such as "It came like this, this is how it goes". Therefore, this month Saturn will once again show our power to transform in one way or another, both individually and socially.</p>
        <p>The full moon in Virgo, which will be experienced on March 18, seems to make us draw a roadmap for what we should and should not carry on our backs, in the transformative effect of Saturn, which we can call fateful in general. Again, it is possible to follow which themes this full moon will highlight in your horoscope from the weekly horoscope comments.</p>
        <p>Towards the end of the month, the fact that the goddess of Mars and Venus is also hand in hand with Saturn, as I said above, the forceful effect they will exert on the lunar nodes will now motivate us much more for change.</p>
        <p>In economic terms, he says, it is necessary to pay attention to the sudden rise and fall of the currency after the second half of the month. Of course, it is useful to be on the alert again about crypto money. Those who have enough money to take risks can win with smart investments.</p>
        <p>March is generally positive. Of course, change is never painless. In this sense, whether we will have difficulties or not is very closely related to what we did or could not do in time.</p>
        <p>I wish you a healthy March in abundance.</p>

        <h3 class="monthly-h3">ARIES</h3>
        <p>Hello dear Aries and ascendant Aries.</p>
        <p> It is a fact that you will experience the most important impact of this month on health and working conditions. It is useful to pay attention to the discomforts caused by the change of seasons in one way or another this month. This month, especially planning and “What more can I do?” It would be appropriate to condition yourself by saying, Pay attention to the first two weeks of the month in financial matters.</p>

        <h3 class="monthly-h3">TAURUS</h3>
        <p>Hello dear Taurus and ascendant Taurus.</p>
        <p>This month, it would be appropriate to say that March will make you look through the door and burn a pickaxe and shovel as "it will make your heart burn" for you. Matters of the heart seem to take a lot of your time. In addition, interesting developments await you in your social life. It is useful to say to the people who have authority, "Okay, it's done, we'll handle it bro" this month.</p>

        <h3 class="monthly-h3">GEMINI</h3>
        <p>Hello dear Gemini and ascendant Gemini.</p>
        <p>It seems that new beginnings and good news will be with you this month. It seems that there are good developments, especially in terms of financial and career. In addition, moving and real estate issues can also keep you a little busy. It is useful to be careful about making the right decisions in this regard. In financial terms, it seems possible to turn the crisis into an advantage. Work, I say.</p>

        <h3 class="monthly-h3">CANCER</h3>
        <p>Hello dear Cancers and ascendant Cancers.</p>
        <p>The most important gain that March will bring to you; we can say that you will gain new people in your life in almost every matter, material and spiritual. You can make short or long term plans. Especially if you are a student crab or need to express yourself with a presentation, it is useful to look at these issues more carefully this month.</p>

        <h3 class="monthly-h3">LEO</h3>
        <p>Hello dear Leos and ascendant Leo.</p>
        <p>The month of March seems to activate you the most in financial matters. If you are a little more cautious about loans and debts until the middle of the month, there may be very positive developments for you. After the second half of the month, you will have to seriously consider and evaluate the opportunities. It will also be a good month for relationships.</p>

        <h3 class="monthly-h3">VIRGO</h3>
        <p>Hello dear Virgos and ascendant Virgos.</p>
        <p>The main theme of this month seems to be a process where you will question how you are positioned towards relationships and life. Therefore, especially if you have a partner, try to express yourself as accurately as possible, and also try to keep yourself in the center of the decisions you will make, because there may be people who are not satisfied with your change and progress.</p>

        <h3 class="monthly-h3">LIBRA</h3>
        <p>Hello dear Libras and ascendant Libras.</p>
        <p>It seems that March will move forward for you on working conditions and money and investment issues in general. In addition, if investment-related issues are on your agenda, especially in the middle of the month, try to make the most rational decisions without risking yourself in this sense. If you feel that you are in doubt, I would say never attempt such things. There may be interesting developments in love.</p>

        <h3 class="monthly-h3">SCORPIO</h3>
        <p>Hello dear scorpions and ascendant Scorpios.</p>
        <p>In the first wound of March, there may be situations in front of you that you can call some financial and moral opportunity. If you cannot evaluate or see these, you will not lose, but you will miss more advantageous conditions. Keep an eye on your surroundings. In the second half of the month, your interest may shift to matters of the heart. You may suddenly find yourself not knowing what to do in front of someone. I say live to the fullest.</p>

        <h3 class="monthly-h3">SAGITTARIUS</h3>
        <p>Hello dear Sagittarius and ascendant Sagittarius ones.</p>
        <p>The first half of the month may be for you to meet more new people and maybe take action to make a joint venture with them. In case of such a development, it would be useful to say no. It can also open the door to positive developments in financial terms. The second half of the month may bring you innovations in family and family matters in general, as well as in finding a format for friend and sibling relations.</p>

        <h3 class="monthly-h3">CAPRICORN</h3>
        <p>Hello dear Capricorns and ascendant Capricorns.</p>
        <p>The month of March for you is literally the month of the plan, the program is the place to say. Every short, long tulle prepares ideal conditions for planning the next 4 months. While in the first half of the month, you are more interested in long-term events, in the second half of the month, your attention seems to be more focused on plans and works related to your environment. At this point, support may come from your close circle.</p>


        <h3 class="monthly-h3">AQUARIUS</h3>
        <p>Hello dear Aquarius and ascendant Aquarius ones.</p>
        <p>In the first half of this month, it is very likely that you will literally say that you are neither on earth nor in heaven. But there are good times for loans and investment, money tracking. In the second half of the month, more career and work-related responsibilities seem to come before you. At this point, you can have a positive month if you are not bloody knives with authority figures.</p>

        <h3 class="monthly-h3">PISCES</h3>
        <p>Hello dear Pisces and ascendant Pisces.</p>
        <p>Of course, March will be good for you, after all, your sun is where it should be and is shining brightly. In this sense, I suggest you evaluate the month of March without saying new moon or full moon. Even if the planet of luck and the sun are in the worst view in all material and spiritual areas, know that it will make breakthroughs that will help you in the sky. I say push the fear aside and be demanding.</p>
