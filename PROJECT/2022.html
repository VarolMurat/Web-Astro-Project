          <p>We have been writing and saying for a long time that 2022 will be a tough year economically. Most countries will not keep accounts of economic growth. Inflation will rise, life will become more expensive. We have breaks in the supply chain, a food crisis ahead of us. In 2023, the economic and food crisis will probably deepen and even turn into a great depression. For us, the main reason for our difficulties in the economic field will be the instability in the foreign exchange. Another problem will be the high energy prices. Credit costs will still remain high. Of course, the risk of food and raw material shortages is also in question for our country. Therefore, it is very important that we focus on production and make rapid reforms in the field of agriculture. Periodic eclipses describe the transformation of the banking system along with the crises. The current system will be transformed with Uranus in Taurus. </p>

          <h2 class="revolt" id="revolt">YEAH, REVOLT!</h2>
          <p style="text-indent: 35px;"> We are moving towards the digital revolution. Significant developments that have already begun will accelerate in 2025. Those who deal with digital and technological jobs and those who provide digital transformation consultancy will also take advantage of this period. Digital marketing, digital payment systems, all project management and cyber security expertise in the digital field will come to the fore because cyber thefts will increase. It will become very important for companies to protect all their information and files. <br> </p>
           <p style="text-indent: 35px;">  Information security analysts will be among the wanted persons. Information and communication technologies, computer operators, computer engineering, wireless operators will develop a lot. All systems, systems and artificial intelligence marketing will come to the fore. New generation robot technologies will develop, investment in robot automation systems will increase, robot coordinators and robotic engineers will be in demand. </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 35px;" class="revolt-text" > There will be new versions of mobile applications as well. Genetic science will develop a lot and geneticists will be more popular. The software industry will develop a lot. The skill of being a software developer will be one of the areas where the highest income will be gained in the upcoming period. Data science/data analysis will gain importance. </p>

          <h2 class="nuclear" id="nuclear">NUCLEAR ?</h2>
          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">In this time period where the type of energy we use will also change, we see electric cars, but they are not the only ones. In fact, electric bicycles and electric motorcycles started to come into play. We will start to see electrical energy in everything, so investment in these areas will increase. Electric vehicles and automobiles will enter our lives more and more. Their market share will increase rapidly. Sales of electronic and electrical appliances will increase. These will become areas that will develop greatly after 2025-2026, but we will get preliminary information this year. <br> </p>
          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Solar energy will be used more in this process. Probably because of this, the temperature will also increase. Therefore, cooling technologies will be one of the important areas to develop. Solar geoengineering is one of the areas to develop. Studies on fusion energy will increase as we move towards the period in which solar activities will increase. Studies on this subject will come to the fore more in 2024-25, when solar flares, which are reported as solar maximum, will increase. Solar panels that have been used for a while can also be made more efficient. Wind turbine service will gain importance. After 2026, related sectors will develop a lot.</p>
          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">  We have a year ahead of us in which conversations and initiatives on nuclear energy will increase. Especially in April-May and October-November. Mostly in November. The use of nuclear energy will still continue. It may even be in line with the decisions to be taken by the joint decisions of some countries. Nuclear power plants will increase. The focus will be on safe nuclear energy solutions.</p>

          <h2 id="freedom" class="freedom">FREEDOM!</h2>
          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Saturn's journey through Aquarius continues until March 7, 2023. We will continue to experience independence, social equality, popular uprisings and the prominence of individual differences this year as well. During this period, difficult events, public revolt, assault on sexual identities and the pursuit of rights, and equality wars will occur in America and Europe. <br> </p>
         <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> There may be a change of government, a change of leaders, the forced resignation of leaders who do not want to leave their seats, or the assassination and terrorist acts that can be committed against a leader in the world. In 2022, in various parts of the world, serious search for rights, technological developments and related cyber attacks, and new developments in space will attract <br></p>
          <p style="text-indent: 25px;" class="changable">The Saturn-Uranus square to be experienced in autumn will increase the rebellions, especially the raising of voices on women's rights may highlight the increase in activist actions. Some kingdoms may end this period. We will experience power wars between states, the increase in tension between Russia and Ukraine, and the escalation of the economic crisis. If we remember that Uranus is in Taurus, we can say that we may encounter earthquakes of moderate intensity and above this year.</p>

          <h2 class="metaverse">METAVERSE...</h2>
              <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Virtual markets, virtual fairs will gain a lot of value. There is a field called virtual reality expertise and we are in a time when this will develop a lot. In the Metaverse universe, which we can define as a virtual reality project, very high real estate sales have been one of the most important agenda items recently.</p> 
              <p style="text-indent: 25px;">From an astrological point of view, we can say that we are in a time where imagination and reality, the virtual and the physical dance in harmony. We can say that the Metaverse will develop and spread faster than expected. We can foresee a rapid expansion and increase in demand in the Metaverse universe in April 2022. Even more, we can think that the land purchased in this universe will quickly become more expensive, or that those who invest in this area will increase rapidly in the spring months. </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> We are in a period where cryptocurrencies will also develop rapidly. In astrology, we explain cryptocurrencies with Uranus in Taurus. Its use in the metaverse universe will contribute to the popularization and spread of cryptocurrencies.</p>

          <h2 class="drought">DROUGHT!</h2>
          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Reforms in the field of horticulture and farming, especially in the field of agriculture is ahead of us. It is necessary to focus on the agriculture and food industry. There are risks of food shortage and damage to agriculture on a global scale in the upcoming period. Accordingly, a stock should be made, it should be prepared! I think that organic agriculture will develop a lot and those who make reforms in the field of agriculture will leap forward. </p>
          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">We are now aware of this, a time period when hygienic and organic materials will already develop. The transit of Uranus in Taurus will definitely increase the tendency towards vegetarian and vegan diets. In addition, new flavors will come into play in the gourmet sector. We have a drought and a food crisis ahead of us. </p>

        <div class="education" id="education">
          <h2 class="zoom">CONTINUE TO ZOOM</h2>
          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Even if we survived the Covid-19 virus, I think that more investment should be made in distance education, as we are in a period where such pandemics are risky. Distance education will continue to evolve. Online education and everything we do online will improve a lot, especially the education system. Teachers no longer have a chance to say "I can't teach online". Therefore, they should develop their skills in this direction as soon as possible. </p>
          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Teachers will remain more like life coaches. Rather than teaching something, they will supervise what is taught. Personal training of students will be on the agenda and astrology will again come into play in a very important way. Astrological charts tell us about one's abilities. Therefore, it is really very important in terms of determining the student's abilities. The schools and the courses we receive face-to-face education individually are changing.Therefore, it is really very important in terms of determining the student's abilities. The schools and the courses we receive face-to-face education individually are changing.</p>
          <p style="text-indent: 25px;" class="therefore">Therefore, interest in schools may decrease. Participation and interest in shopping centers and show centers will decrease. We will experience transformations in printed books, magazines and newspapers. The publishing field will begin to transform into a digital system. Libraries will now become structures that present their archives more electronically. We will move forward by thoroughly changing our digitalization and information acquisition habits. Systems that will increase the chance of accessing a large number of information at the same time and that will help with elimination will develop.</p>

          <h2 class="retro">RETROGRADE</h2>
          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Mercury will go retrograde 3 times throughout the year. Since professional issues will be at the forefront in Aquarius retrograde between January 14 and February 4, do not start a new job, do not sign, review your contract down to the smallest detail, ask an expert if possible. Technological devices may break down, do not buy a new one. Back up your information</p>
          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Gemini retrograde from May 9 to June 3 in the 7th house will reveal disagreements and misunderstandings in all bilateral relationships. Pay attention to your communication language, especially avoid arguments with your family, spouse and partner. Do not trade real estate. Don't get married, don't get married. If you are starting a new relationship, be cautious. Avoid new partnership decisions.</p>
          <p style="text-indent: 25px;" class="mercur-text">September 9 - October 2 Libra retrograde again emphasizes correspondence, contracts and signatures. Problems may occur due to lack of attention, the news you expect may come late. Avoid new business deals. Postpone activities such as social media, advertising and promotion. Don't buy a car or a house. 'So what shall we do?If you say, evaluate your unfinished topics in retro history. Address topics that you have not completed in the past. For example, organize your wardrobe, get rid of the things you don't need.</p>

          <p style="text-indent: 25px;">We will end 2022 with Mars retrograde. Between October 29, 2022 – January 13, 2023, Mars will retrograde in Gemini and will reveal important events in the world. Mars is the energy of war and anger. During this period, wars and explosions may occur in the world. Individual haste and anger should be avoided. Since it will be an accident-prone situation, it is necessary to be careful especially while driving.</p>

Therefore, those working in this field, especially those who export, will take advantage. Technology will make a big difference in the fashion industry. Maybe we can see clothes that protect from bacteria and viruses. Ecological textiles will develop. Nature-friendly product offering will increase. Reforms in the field of cosmetics are likely. We see innovations in this field, as soap manufacturers and cosmetologists fall under the sign of Taurus.</p>
